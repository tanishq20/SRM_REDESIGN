        <p>There are many opportunities at SRM Institute of Science and Technology (formerly known as SRM University)
          for students to engage in service to the community - through healthcare camps, blood donation, advocacy
          campaigns or working with schools for the underprivileged. <br>
          Students are encouraged to take up community service through NSS or join any of the community service
          projects, to give back to the community. <br><br>
          <span> National Service Scheme (NSS)</span> <br>
          The NSS unit at SRM Institute of Science and Technology (formerly known as SRM University) has more than 1000
          registered students. Prof. T. Rajasekaran, Department of Mechanical Engineering is the Programme Co-ordinator.
          <br><br><span>National Cadet Corps(NCC)</span> <br>
          The objective of National Cadet Corps is to develop character, comradeship, and capacity for leadership among

        <h1>CASTE DISCRIMINATION</h1>
        <p>
          <span>"We are Indians, firstly & lastly": Dr. Ambedkar</span> <br>

          Caste prejudiced violence and sentiments are rising throughout our nation. Cutting across the religious and
          cultural divide, such hostility threaten the community of minorities. In the land where leaders like Gandhi
          and Ambedkar relentlessly strived for the abolition of the caste system, we now have instances of
          discrimination in educational institutions. This sorry state of affairs is highly condemned by the UGC and
          Indian Law. Being temples of learning, educational institutions should inculcate in the minds of faculty and
          students that people should protect and defend the dignity of each individual through respect for human rights
          and the rule of law. <br> <br>

          With a view to providing a safe and secure learning ambiance for the students, SRM Institute of Science and
          Technology (formerly known as SRM University) takes every possible step to eradicate any form of caste - based
          prejudices and discrimination in its facilities. The management along with the complete support of its faculty
          and staff has been able to maintain a peaceful environment where no sign of discrimination is tolerated. With
          its 25 plus years of meritorious service in the educational sector, the SRM Group has built its positive
          reputation among people of the different strata of the society. Merits-based and other need based Scholarships
          are given to deserving candidates. SRMU has to its credit a globally acknowledged multicultural educational
          space. Within SRMU we value learning, mutual respect, teamwork, and diverse points of view. <br> <br>

          SRMU has set motivated goals for accomplishing measurable out comes as to make a difference in our students'
          lives. The University has left no stone unturned to set an environment of freedom to the students during their

          particular faculty / peers due to their extremist and biased belief in caste, the person can lodge a complaint

        <h2>ANTI-RAGGING</h2>
        <p>
          College/ University campus is a place to find valuable friendship and to cherish unforgettable moments. We,
          here at SRM strongly condemn any kind of ragging practices. Our students welcome the freshers with flowers and
          advices and they do not believe in violence or unhealthy practices. Our faculty members impart good values
          with education and that is what set SRM apart. <br> <br>
          <span> Do not be a victim or witness!! <br>
            Say No to Ragging!! <br> <br> Ragging constitutes one or more of any of the following acts : <br></span>
          <li>Any conduct by any student or students whether by words spoken or written or by an act which has the
            effect of
            teasing, treating or handling with rudeness a fresher or any other student.</li>
          <li>Indulging in rowdy or indisciplined activities by an y student or students which causes or is likely to
            cause annoyance, hardship, physical or psychological harm
            or to raise fear or apprehension thereof in any fresher or any other student.</li>
          <li>Asking any student to do any act which such student will not in the ordinary course do and which has the
            effect of causing or generating a sense of shame, or torment or embarrassment so as to adversely affect the
            physique or psyche of such fresher or any other student.</li>
          <li>Any act by a senior student that prevents, disrupts or disturbs the regular academic activity of any other
            student or a fresher.</li>
<br><br>
          <span style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: large;">Actions Suggested by AICTE against students indulging and abetting in Ragging:</span><br> <br>
          <li>The punishment to be meted out to the persons indulged in ragging has to be exemplary and justifiably
            harsh to
            act as a deterrent against recurrence of such incidents. The students who are found to be indulged in
            ragging
            should be debarred from taking admission in any technical institution in India.</li>
          <li> Every single incident of ragging a First Information Report (FIR) must be filed without exception by the
            institutional authorities with the local police authorities.</li>
          <li>The institutional authority shall intimate the incidents of ragging occurred in their premises along with
            actions taken to the Council immediately after occurrence of such incident and inform the status of the case
            from time to time.</li>
          <li>Courts should make an effort to ensure that cases involving ragging are taken up on priority basis to send
            the correct message that ragging is not only to be discouraged but also to be dealt with sternness.</li>
